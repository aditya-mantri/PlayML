      2. [Support Vector machine](https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/contrihub-svm)
      3. [K-Means Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/sidagar/contrihub-k-means)

## Plotly issues description:
* Plotly issues have been divided into 3 main parts.
  1. Plotly-line
  2. Plotly-scatter
  3. Plotly-animated
* Each person can only solve a maximum of two issues under each of the three categories. 
* In addition to the above constraint, a person can only sove a maximum of 3 issues from the category 1 and category 2 combined.

## Contribution guidelines(specifically for plotly issues):
1. Have the issues alloted to you by the mentor.
2. Refer to the required expectedoutput.html matching to the issue alloted to you in the expected outputs folder.
3. Change the code accordingly and make a contribution.

Tips: You can contact the mentor if you are stuck somewhere or need help regarding the color/type of markers or any other graph constants in order to match them up with the expected outputs.
