        "Logistic regression is similar to linear regression because both of these involve estimating the values of parameters used in the prediction equation based on the given training data. Linear regression predicts the value of some continuous, dependent variable. Whereas logistic regression predicts the probability of an event or class that is dependent on other factors. Thus the output of logistic regression always lies between 0 and 1. Because of this property it is commonly used for classification purpose."

Thus $ln(\\frac{p}{1-p})$ is known as the *log odds* and is simply used to map the probabilty that lies between 0 and 1 to a range between $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$. The terms $b_0, b_1, b_2 ...$ are parameters (or weights) that we will estimate during training.   \n",

This function can be broken down as:\n",
